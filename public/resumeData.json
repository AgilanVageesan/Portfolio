        "text": "Agilan, a humble young grad, comes from a city of natural beaches, beautiful hotels, pubs, and bars with his funny yet beautiful french.
        In just two years, I have seen him transforming closely from a newbie to a true craftsman. Of course, the most challenging part was he not being from a computer science background. But I guess it didn't bother him because of his child-like curiosity and innocence, making him a swift learner. When it comes to ownership and accountability, he sees the task reaches a logical conclusion. His experience does not stop him from asking anyone or pointing out if someone is cutting the corner, even when that person is his boss or boos' boss. Every repetition is an opportunity for automation is his mantra, and he truly lives by that. He has automated so many tasks in his team.
        To summarise, a jolly friend, the go-to person when in need, Mr. Dependable for almost anything, always ready to learn and seek feedback from anybody is Agilan for me",
